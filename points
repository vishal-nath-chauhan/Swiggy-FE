1)Reactjs project starts with index.js file
2)We can start the project with another file instead of App.js as index.js is the dependency ,not app.js
3)react is an SPA because evry file is accessed from index.html via a div having id as root,every page is inserted in this root element.There is only 1 html file which is rendered.

4)React breaks the react code in bundle.js in pure javascript so that the browser can understand it.

5)we pass the data from parent to child via props.

6)props always come in the form of objects

7)useState's function eg setName etc. is an asynchronous function

8)React renders only on 2 things,states and props

9)Useeffect function works on componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount

on mount=useEffect(()=>{logic or function call},[])

on update=useEffect(()=>{logic or function call},[dependency array]}

only state or props have to be passed in the dependency array nothing else

on unmount=useEffect(()=>{logic or function call return ()=>{logic for unmounting}},[]}
10)We should try not to update a state in useEffect or atleast do not put the state variable in dependency array otherwise it will execute infinite times.
